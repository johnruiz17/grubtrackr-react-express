GrubTrackr is a location-based restaurant recommendation platform built with React and Express.js.  It helps users find restaurants nearby by:

* Displaying detailed restaurant information, including address, phone number, and rating.
* Utilizing Yelp API calls to retrieve a list of local restaurants based on user search.
* Integrating Google Maps API to display pin locations for each listed restaurant.
* Showcasing customer reviews fetched from Yelp when a user clicks on a restaurant card.
* Implementing Redux Toolkit for robust application state management.
